prime number means what?
= if number is divisible by 1 and itself 
then 1 is a prime number ?
= no one is not a prime number
why ? becoz 1 is divisible by one only , it has no two factors 
if a number has two factors divisible by 1 and number itself then it is said to be Prime Number.

//program for prime or not in java
import java.util.*;
public class Main{
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("Enter the Number");
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        int count =0;
        if(n<=0)
        {
            System.out.println("Not a Valid number");
        }
        else{
            for(int i=1;i<=n;i++){
                if(n%i==0)
                count++;
                
            }
            if(count==2)
            {
                System.out.println("The given number is prime");
            }
            else
            System.out.println("Not a Prime");
        }
    }
}
